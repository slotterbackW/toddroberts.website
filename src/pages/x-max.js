      <p>Max Plansky is a 17-year-old kid who loves video games. Max also has been diagnosed with cerebral palsy and has very limited mobility. Currently, in order for him to play video games he dictates to someone else what he would like to do and they play for him. I am the project leader of a seven-person team, backed by Enabling Engineering, that is creating a custom controller which will allow Max to play video games independently. Max’s strongest muscle is his neck, so the controller is designed to be operated with his head. As the sole mechanical engineer during the first part of this project, I was responsible for the design and construction of all physical components. I designed the first prototype from scratch and built it out of plywood, PVC, Loc-Line modular hose, custom 3D printed parts and an assortment of GoPro hardware. I created the 3-D printed components in SolidWorks and then printed them using a university printer. The team has since expanded and we are now working on the second version of our device. During this project I have gained significant experience with the engineering design process, budgeting, and troubleshooting. More importantly I have had the chance to use my skills as an engineer to better the life of another individual.</p>

      <p>This project is just one of the many student projects in the university club, Enabling Engineering.

      <p>These are screenshots of the X-Max assembly I created in SolidWorks. The parts highlighted in purple are the custom parts I 3D printed. They allow the store bought buttons to interface with the flexible GoPro assembly. I built the main box (yellow) out of 3/4in plywood to lower cost and speed up the prototyping process while still providing necessary structural rigidity. The white tubes are PVC and the button assemblies are made from GoPro hardware and Loc-Line modular hose. The flexibility of the Loc-Line hose allows the buttons to be positioned at virtually any angle and the GoPro “Roll Bar Mount” can slide to any position along the PVC depending on the user's size and posture. The four legs attached to the back of the box are used to mount the unit to the chair. The bottom two legs are made from an old tripod allowing the angle of the entire unit to be adjusted.</p>

      <p>I created the below component in SolidWorks to hold an array of LED’s. The component sits in front of the user and when they press a button with their head the LED in the location of the corresponding button on a traditional controller lights up. This provides the user instant feedback and helps them learn the controls.</p>
